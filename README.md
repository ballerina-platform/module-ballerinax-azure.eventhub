[Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) is a fully managed, real-time data ingress service that is highly scalable, secured, open, and reliable. It ingests data (events) from different sources and reliably distributes it between multiple independent systems for processing, storage, and analysis.

Azure Event Hubs [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) connector is used to connect with the Azure Event Hubs to ingest millions of events per second so that you can process and analyze the massive amounts of data produced by your connected devices and applications.
